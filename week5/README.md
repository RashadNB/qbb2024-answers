# 1.1
- The base content incongruencies may arise from biased sampling during RNA cleavage or primer-related amplification errors, potentially explaining the GC content variations and additional peaks observed in FastQC analysis.

# 1.2
- The sequences of serine proteases are the most represented which makes sense given the tissue type used here is from the gut and serine proteases are digestive enzymes.

# 2
- I would keep 15 samples.
- Replicates within a triplicate are close together, suggesting that the replicates were produced in a very consistent way.

# 3.1 
- LFC-Fe replicate 3 and Fe replicate 1 are flipped.
