# Exercise 3.1
- Nascent RNA is measuring the level of transcription occuring in each nucleus, while PCNA is measuring the amount of DNA sythesis occuring. Therefore by taking the ratio of one to the other we are getting the ratio of RNA transcription to DNA replication

# Exercise 3.2
- It's a little hard to tell, but I would say SRSF1 has the highest ratio of transcription to translation when knocked out. Since it regulates splicing, more RNAs will retain introns when it is knocked down and may be characterized mistakenly as "nascent", which bumps the ratio up. APEX1 knockdown appears to have the lowest ratio, which I find confusing since it repairs DNA. I would think that more DNA damage would mean less replication so this is quite confusing.
